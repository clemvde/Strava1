I am a vivid runner and cyclist. Since a couple of years,
I'm recording almost all
my activities with some kind of GPS device.

I record my runs with a Garmin device and my bike rides with a Wahoo 
device. Both accounts get synchronized with my Strava account. I figured
that it would be nice to directly access my data from my Strava account.

In the following text, I will describe the
progress to get the data into R.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("libraries.R")

Sys.setenv("RSTUDIO_VERSION" = '1.4.1725')
df_manifest <- tar_manifest(
  fields = c("name", "command", "pattern", "cue_mode"))
```

In this analysis, the following packages are used:

```{r, code=read_lines("libraries.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

# Data {.tabset}

The whole data pipeline is implemented with the help of the `targets` package.
[Here](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) you can learn more about the package
and its functionalities.

## Target Plan

The manifest of the target plan looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_manifest %>%
  filter(
    str_detect(name, "^strava", negate = TRUE), name != "athlete_id") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

The most important targets of the plan are described in detail in the following
subsections.

## OAuth Dance from R

To get access to your Strava data from R, you have to create a Strava api.
How to do this is
documented [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/).

The Strava api requires a so called OAuth dance. How this
can be done from within R is described in the following section.

Create an OAuth Strava app:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "my_app", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/define_strava_app.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

You can find your `STRAVA_KEY` and `STRAVA_SECRET` variables under the Strava 
api settings after you have created your own personal api. The name of api is
determined during creation. In my case I named it `r_api`.

Define an endpoint:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "my_endpoint", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/define_strava_endpoint.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

The `authorize` parameter describes the authorization url.
And the `access` argument is used to exchange the authenticated token.

The final authentication step. Before the user can execute the following steps,
he has to authenticate the api in the web browser.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "my_sig", ] %>%
  mutate(cue_mode = "always") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/define_strava_sig.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

The information in `my_sig` can now be used to access Strava data. Set the
`cue_mode` of the target to 'always', so that the user has to authenticate and
the following api calls are all executed with an up to date authorization
token.

## Activities

We are now authenticated and can directly access Strava data.
At first load an overview table of all available activities.
Because the total number of activities is unknown, use a while loop.
Break the execution of the loop, if there are no more activities to read.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_act_raw", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/read_all_activities.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

The resulting data frame consists of one row per activity:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_act_raw)
```

Preprocess activities. Make sure that all id columns are represented as
characters and improve the column names:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_act", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/pre_process_act.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

Extract all ids of the activities:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "act_ids", ])
```

## Measurements

Read the ‘stream’ data from Strava.
A ‘stream’ is a nested list (json format) with all available measurements
of the corresponding activity.

To get all available variables and turn the result into a data frame, 
define a helper function. This function takes an id of an activity and
an authentication token, which we have created earlier.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_meas", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/read_activity_stream.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

The target is defined with dynamic branching which maps over all activity ids.
Define the cue mode as `never` to make sure, that every target runs exactly
once.

Bind the single targets into one data frame:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_meas_all", ])
```

The data now is represented by one row per measurement series:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_meas_all)
```

Turn the data into a wide format:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_meas_wide", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/meas_wide.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

In this format every activity is one row again:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_meas_wide)
```

Preprocess and unnest the data. The column `latlng` needs special attention,
because it contains latitude and longitude information. Separate the two
measurements before unnesting all list columns.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "df_meas_pro", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/meas_pro.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

After this step every row is one point in time and every column is (if present)
a measurement at this point in time.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tar_read(df_meas_pro)
```

# Visualisation

Visualize the final data by displaying the geospatial information in the data.
Every facet is one activity. Keep the rest of the plot as minimal as possible.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df_manifest[df_manifest$name == "gg_meas", ])
```

```{r, code=read_lines("R/vis_meas.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("gg_meas.png")
```
